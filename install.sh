# Downloads one binary for this machine, checks it against the published
# SHA256SUMS, and puts it somewhere on PATH. Nothing else — no daemon, no
# configuration, no root.
#
# Linux only, because Windows does not run this and no macOS build is published
# yet. Both of those are refused by name, with somewhere to go.
#
# THE WHOLE BODY IS INSIDE main(), CALLED ON THE LAST LINE, for the same reason
# the one-box installer is written that way: piping into a shell executes what
# has arrived so far, and a truncated download of this script must do nothing at
# all rather than half of something.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose. This runs on machines nobody has prepared, where /bin/sh
# is as likely to be dash as bash.
#
# It never uses sudo. A one-line install that escalates is a worse trade than an
# install that lands in ~/.local/bin and says so.

Options:
  --dir DIR         install into DIR instead of the default. The default is
                    /usr/local/bin when this user can write to it, and
                    ~/.local/bin otherwise. sudo is never used.
  --version X.Y.Z   install that release instead of the one this script was
                    published with. `latest` follows the newest release.
  -q, --quiet       print the installed path and nothing else
  -h, --help        this

Uninstalling is deleting the file; it is the whole install.
